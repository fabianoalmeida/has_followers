*ATTENTION:* This is a Rails 3 only implementation.

NOTE: It's necessary to a *User* model exist. Executing the migration it will add two columns in <code>users</code> table: <code>followeds_count</code> and <code>followers_count</code>.

== Installation
* The first step is add this gem to your Gemfile <code>gem 'has_followers'</code>
* After that, install the gem in your development environment <code>bundle install</code>
* Execute the migration generator to create the necessary tables and columns <code>rails g has_followers:migration</code>
* Run the migrations with <code>rake db:migrate</code>

== Usage
It's very simple to use this gem. See the examples below.

First, you'll need to add the <code>has_followers</code> method to your model.
 class User < ActiveRecord::Base
   has_followers
 end

To follow someone you need only do this
 you.follow(someone)
This action automatically increment your <code>followeds_count</code> column and his (someone) <code>followers_count</code> column too.

If you want to unfollow someone, no problem. It's similar to follow someone
 you.unfollow(someone)
When you <code>unfollow</code> someone, this automatically decrement your <code>followeds_count</code> column and his (someone) <code>followers_count</code> column too.

You can check how many users you are following
 you.followeds_count

Or how many users are following you
 you.follwers_count

If you want to know who are your followeds users
 you.followeds

And your followers
 you.followers

Check if the user is you
 you.is?(someone) # => true if someone is you

If you want to know if you are following someone
 you.following?(someone) # => Follow object if you already following someone

If you want to know if someone is following you
 you.follow_me?(someone) # => Follow object if he is following you

Or in case you want to know the relationship between you and your followed or follower
 you.following_for(someone)
Or
 you.followed_for(someone)

The first one will find on your followeds list, however the second one will find on your followers list.
